# Smart Library (Frontend Demo)

Simple frontend-only library management demo. Add books, search, issue/return and delete. Data is stored in browser localStorage so nothing is uploaded to server.

## How to use
- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click) OR host via GitHub Pages for easy sharing.
- Use the form to add a book.
- Use Issue/Return buttons to mark circulation.

## To upload to GitHub (quick):
1. Create a new repository (name: `smart-library`).
2. Add files: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`.
3. Commit and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Branch: `main` → /root).

That's it — your site will be available at `https://<mohammedarqamahmed>.github.io/smart-library` shortly after enabling Pages.
